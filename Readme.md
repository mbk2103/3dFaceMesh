# Face Mesh Algorithm

## Introduction

This project involves developing a Face Mesh algorithm capable of mapping and identifying various facial features and contours. The algorithm creates a detailed mesh overlay on a human face, accurately detecting facial landmarks, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline. It is designed to adapt to different facial expressions and orientations, producing a precise 3D mesh useful for applications in facial recognition, augmented reality, and animation. The focus is on optimizing the algorithm for accuracy and real-time performance, ensuring it can handle a variety of lighting conditions and face types.

## Installation

To run the Face Mesh algorithm, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```
Usage
Import the necessary libraries and execute the provided Python script:
```bash
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
from google.colab import drive
import time

# ... (rest of the code)
```
Ensure that you have Google Colab installed to run the code interactively.

The FaceMeshProcessor class is the core component of the Face Mesh algorithm. It provides methods for processing both images and videos, drawing Face Mesh overlays, and handling input/output.

## Methods
- is_image(): Check if the input source is an image.
- draw_face_mesh(frame, face_landmarks): Draw Face Mesh on the frame.
- process_video(): Process video input and display the output in real-time.
- process_image(): Process image input and display the output.

## Example Usage
```bash
# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
# Define input and output paths
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_source = '/content/drive/MyDrive/path/to/here'
    output_file = '/content/drive/MyDrive/path/to/here.avi'

    # Create FaceMeshProcessor instance and process input
    face_mesh_processor = FaceMeshProcessor(input_source, output_file)
```
Replace the input_source and output_file variables with your desired paths.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs and contribute to the improvement of the Face Mesh algorithm.

Happy coding!
